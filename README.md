# MapViewer
Is a Windows application that displays information extracted from the MAP file (generated by the GNU linker LD) and from the ELF executable image. It displays the module/file wise split of resources consumed along with details of individual symbols found within each module/file. Each view can be filtered and sorted dynaimically allowing the user to quickly calculate the sizes of various modules and symbols or identify those modules that are perhaps unintentionally included in a project. All the list view magic is courtesy of [ObjectListView](http://objectlistview.sourceforge.net/cs/index.html)

The application looks like this:

It was primarily developed for use with the **FTDI [FT900](http://www.ftdichip.com/MCU.html)** Microcontroller and associated toolchain but is generic enough to be useable for other GCC based toolchains. I've tested it with **Microchip's XC16 compiler** and should also be useful for XC32 (with some minimal porting).

I've written a blog post with more details on the application here.
